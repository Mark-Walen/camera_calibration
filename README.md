# Camera Calibration for Mono and Stereo

This repository provides tools for camera calibration, supporting both mono and stereo camera setups. The goal of this project is to offer an easy-to-use, flexible camera calibration process that can be run anywhere, without the need for ROS dependencies.

## Background

The ROS2 camera calibration tool is incredibly useful, with an automatic rule to determine if an image is good enough to be used for calibration. While this is a great feature, it requires a ROS setup, which may not always be ideal in certain environments or devices.

This project draws inspiration from the ROS2 camera calibration tool and acknowledges its foundational work in simplifying camera calibration processes. The main aim here is to remove ROS dependencies, allowing camera calibration to be performed on any device, anywhere—whether you're using a standalone camera or have a ROS-based setup.

## Features

- **Mono Camera Calibration**: Perform calibration with a single camera using a checkerboard or any other calibration target.
- **Stereo Camera Calibration**: Calibrate stereo camera pairs, including both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
- **No ROS Required**: Unlike the standard ROS calibration tools, this method doesn’t rely on ROS, making it ideal for devices that don't run ROS or for users who prefer not to have ROS dependencies.
- **Portable**: This calibration tool can be used on any system that supports Python, offering high portability.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Other dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file.

## How to Use

### Monocular Calibration
1. Basic calibration using a single camera:
    ```shell
    python cameracalibrator.py mono --source 0 --size 9x6 --square 0.015
    ```
2. Setting a specific resolution:
    ```shell
    python cameracalibrator.py mono --source 0 --size 9x6 --square 0.015 --width 640 --height 480
    ```

### Stereo Calibration
1. Using a single camera with left and right frames in one image:
    ```shell
    python cameracalibrator.py stereo --source 0 --size 9x6 --square 0.015
    ```
2. Using two separate camera IDs for stereo input:
    ```shell
    python cameracalibrator.py stereo --source 0 1 --size 9x6 --square 0.015
    ```
3. Setting a specific resolution:
    ```shell
    python cameracalibrator.py stereo --source 0 --size 9x6 --square 0.015 --width 640 --height 480
    ```

## Removing ROS Dependencies

One of the key features of this project is the ability to run the calibration process without ROS. By removing ROS dependencies, this tool provides greater flexibility and usability across different devices and environments, allowing camera calibration processes to be run from the command line or integrated into a larger project seamlessly.

## Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the ROS2 camera calibration tool, which provided a solid foundation and valuable insights into the calibration process. While this tool operates independently of ROS, it builds upon concepts introduced by ROS to ensure reliability and user-friendliness.
